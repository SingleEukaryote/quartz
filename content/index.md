**protist.info** aims to be a comprehensive, free resource organizing and linking all knowledge about protists. The main site, though not yet available, will bring together general information about protists (the why and what).

**notebook.protist.info** focuses on protist research (the how). Sharing institutional knowledge, online resources, and historical texts. It spans **culturing**, **microscopy**, and **molecular work**, compiling effective protocols for researching protists. To contribute, [[Make changes|send a message]], with your ideas or information. 

[[protocols]]

[[recipes]]

Everyone can do science. To encourage this, notebook.protist.info is continuously adding and updating protocols with frugality in mind. Not everyone has access to a laboratory or expensive equipment. Thus, we will attempt to provide multiple routes to achieve a certain task when possible (Ex. [[Sterilizing things]])).

*Guides join multiple protocols together to show what is possible*

**Philosophies**

What are saltwater, freshwater, and terrestrial protists? And how does the knowledge of their environment help you in culturing and researching them?

Thinking on the micro-level

Linking to the best instead of creating new. If I can't write anything better, I will provide the resource here or link to it.

Provide “substitutions” or alternatives to lab gear with gear you can find in a house or local grocery store.

There are more than one way to do something. So I will compile multiple ways here.
