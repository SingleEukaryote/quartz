Hello all,

The goal of protist.info is to be an all-inclusive, free resource, with all the available knowledge about protists and for researching them too.

The base website, **protist.info**, is to make general information on protists accessible (the why and what). This is not yet available. Here are some papers if you are interested in what protists are and why they are intriguing to biologists.

notebook.protist.info is specifically for performing research on protists. This includes institutional knowledge (shared between the academics), compiling resources already on the web, and unearthing historical texts that may be of use. The body of knowledge being created here concerns **culturing**, **microscopy**, **molecular work**, and **bioinformatics**. If you would like to participate in this journey, please [[message]] me with the content that you'd like to contribute.

**Guides**

*Guides join multiple protocols together to help you form a clearer path for your protist research ideas*

Isolating and culturing amoebae for beginners

How to do timelapse micrography

Working with dung-dwelling protists

**Philosophies**

What are saltwater, freshwater, and terrestrial protists? And how does the knowledge of their environment help you in culturing and researching them?

Thinking on the micro-level

Linking to the best instead of creating new. If I can't write anything better, I will provide the resource here or link to it.
