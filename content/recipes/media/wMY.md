>Another really weak agar medium that works well for us is wMY (0.002g malt extract, 0.002 yeast extract, 0.75g dibasic potassium phosphate, 15g agar/liter), a medium developed by Margaret Nesom for work with the sorocarpic amoeba *Copromyxa protea*, and used in our lab as the standard medium for protosteloid amoebae and dictys. Its low nutrient content keeps bacterial growth limited and it works really well for all sorts of amoeboid protists.

This is a low-nutrient freshwater medium. Used commonly in both agar and liquid form for working with terrestrial and freshwater protists.

*Fill to 1L with diH2O and sterilize.*

## Brown Lab recipe

Through research developed by Matthew Brown, we no longer add yeast or malt extract. This new version of wMY is easier to make and the lack of nutrients does not appear to affect any culturing processes. This is now essentially a dibasic potassium phosphate solution. As a new standard, we use [[Spring water agar]] (SWA) for culturing most amoebae. If you do not want to use bottle spring water, wMY is a good subsitute.
