Historically, throughs methods used by Fred Spiegel, we used [[wMY]] agar and a [[Food sources|food source]] for culturing amoebae. This works well. However, we found that bottled spring water works just as well and is easier to use. Spring water agar, like [[wMY]], is adept for culturing most amoebae. In a pinch, when traveling or doing field work, bottle water is your friend. The brands we use in the Brown Lab are typically Evian, Deer Park, or Ozark, but most spring water brands should work. The ideas here is that spring water specifically has salts and minerals that create an ideal isotonic environment for culturing your freshwater or terrestrial protists.

| Ingredient           | Mass |
| -------------------- | ---- |
| Bottled spring water | 1 L  |
| Agar                 | 15g  |

*Sterilize*

**Note: using (free) environmental spring water sources**

While success for culturing isn’t guaranteed, it is most likely fine if you use natural water sources from your area (reservoirs, lakes, streams), and especially from where you’ve isolated the protist you want to culture. When using environmental water sources, you will need to sterilize it before culturing.
