This is a medium we use to grow bacteria as a [[Food sources|food source]]. As a lab standard we use it to grow *Escherichia coli* (strain K-12 MG1655). For cloning, we use Kanamycin and X-gal for plasmid and insert selection.

| Total volume | Tryptone | Yeast Extract | NaCl | Agar (Optional) | Kanamycin (Optional) |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- | ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 500 mL       | 5g       | 2.5g          | 5g   | 7.5g            | 500uL                        |
| 1 L          | 10g      | 5g            | 10g  | 15g             | 1 mL                         |

- Add Kanamycin after medium cools to ~50C
	- 50mg/mL stock [[Kanamycin solution]] → 50ug/mL working solution. Add 1mL to 1L of LB agar.
- Add X-gal
	- 30mg/mL stock [[Xgal solution]] → 30ug/mL working solution. Add 1 mL to 1L of LB agar.
