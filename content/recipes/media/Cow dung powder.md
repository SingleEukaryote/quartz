Used in the creation of [[Dung Powder Agar (DPA)|DPAclear]]

1. Acquire good cow dung from a person or place that has cows. Good properties of dung are as follows:
	1. Semi-fresh and porridge-like consistency.
	2. It is not smelly (typical beef cattle that are fed corn and grains have thin and smelly poop - this is no good).
	3. Fibrous - you want to acquire poop from grass/hay fed cows.
2. Place a decent amount of dung into a glass container (I use 2L beakers), covering the top with foil.
3. Sterilize using a [[Sterilizing media with a pressure cooker|pressure cooker]] or autoclave. 
4. Dry dung using a lab oven or even your kitchen oven at 60-70C (150-160F).
	1. Option 1: Dry while still in the beaker.
	2. Option 2: Lay out a cookie sheet on a metal pan, and place dung evenly across its surface.
5. Once dry, use a kitchen blender to turn the dung into a powder quickly. Alternatively you can use a mortal and pestle.
	1. **Note:** At this point I where a mask to avoid breathing in airborne poop powder.
6. To obtain a fine powder, I use a fine mesh strainer (sieve) at various sizes. 
	1. Keeping the smallest particles in your powder mixture may matter in the creation of [[Dung Powder Agar (DPA)|DPAclear]]. I recommend not selecting for only larger particles.
