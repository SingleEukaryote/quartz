## Preparation of the cells
1 dense pellet of cells is needed in a 1.5 mL tube. However cultures you deem necessary. (5?)
- *It helps if there are bacteria with the cells, as this creates a better, more visible pellet.*

### For liquid cultures

1. Use a method of suspending the cells into the medium.
    1. A cell scrapper puts cells into solution well.
    2. Vigorous shaking of the flask could work. Try hitting it against the palm of your hand.
    3. Bubble and wash with a sterile bulb pipet may also work.
2. Pour the cell suspension into 50 mL tube(s).
3. Centrifuge tubes at 700-1500 rcf for 5 minutes. 
	1. If you do not see pellets, spin at higher rcfs.
4. Pour off supernatant carefully from all tubes.
5. Use residual liquid to resuspend the pellets in and transfer them all to one 1.5 mL tube.
6. Centrifuge the 1.5mL tube at 4000 x g for 3 minutes.
	1. During this time, quickly make [[SFB - Simultaneous Fixation Buffer]], keep on ice.
	2. Discard all tips that touch these chemicals into a dry chemical waste container.
7. Check for a pellet and pour off supernatant carefully.
8. Add 500 μL of SFB, resuspend the pellet, and keep on ice for 30 minutes .
	1. While waiting, parafilm OsO4 and store it and the glutaraldehyde in 4C.
	2. Store parafilm and store Cacodylate at -20C.
9. Spin tube quickly to make the pellet. 
	1. (I did 4000 x g for 3 min again)
10. Discard supernatant into corn oil OsO4 waste.
11. Wash the pellet with 500 μL of fresh media.
12. Wash *twice* with 500 μL of ddH2O.
13. Remove 400 μL of the last wash (leaving ~ 100 μL)
	1. You make want less liquid to work with in the next steps. Taking more supernatant out may benefit you.
14. Resuspend the pellet in the residual liquid.

## Enrobing in agarose

```ad-reagents
- 2% agarose solution made with sterile di-H20. (30 mL, 0.6g)
	- To keep liquid, microwave a large beaker of water to boiling to serve as a heat bath.

>[!gear]
> - Eyelash probe (Make fresh prior, find someone to donate quality lashes)
> - Cleaned slides (2-3)
> - Cleaned coverslips (2-3)
> - Bulb pipets
*This is a difficult process to describe in writing.*
*You’ll be working underneath a stereoscope during this process.*

| 1   | Use a pipet to make a bed of agar on a clean slide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 11.53.59.excalidraw.svg]] |                                                                  |
| 2   | Pipet your fixed resuspended pellet liquid onto the solid agar bed and wait 5-10 minutes for liquid to be absorbed. *Note: at this point, you want your cells (now a black mush) to be semi-solid so you can manipulate them into a pile on the agar*                                  | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 12.11.32.excalidraw.svg]] | ![[20220617_142553.jpg]]                                         |
| 3   | As water is being absorbed into the agar, use your [[Eyelash probe]] to carefully ‘sweep’ the gooey black mass of cells into two (or more) small piles. This will take some time depending on how much water is there.                                                                 | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 12.36.56.excalidraw.svg]] | ![[20220617_144716.jpg]] ![[20220617_145927 1.jpg]]              |
| 4   | Make the piles as compact and small as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 12.42.44.excalidraw.svg]] | ![[20220617_150404.jpg]]                                         |
| 5   | Place a drop (or two) of molten agar on top of each pile, completely submerging them. Wait until solid.                                                                                                                                                                                | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 13.10.44.excalidraw.svg]] | ![[20220617_151416.jpg]]                                         |
| 6   | Using a coverslip, cut a square around the small pile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 14.53.50.excalidraw.svg]] | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 14.53.50.excalidraw.svg]] |
| 7   | Use the coverslip to pick up the agar-encased black pile. (*Note* there are two layers here, the top layer with the pick and the original agar bottom layer.) Make sure the bottom part of the pile is on the coverslip, as if you are sliding the coverslip underneath to pick it up. |                                                                  | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 14.59.09.excalidraw.svg]] |
| 8   | On another agar slide bed, cut two small squares to place your sample block into. Place the block with the exposed sample side facing the inner part of the square.                                                                                                                    |                                                                  | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 15.13.12.excalidraw.svg]] |
| 9   | Drop molten agar onto the block until submerged completely (1 or 2 drops). This will fully ‘enrobe’ your gooey black pile of fixed cells in agar, protecting it from being resuspending during the dehydration and resin embedding process!                                            | ![[TEM of adherent protists 2022-06-19 15.21.03.excalidraw.svg]] | ![[20220617_152408.jpg]]                                         |
| 10  | Cut your sample out using a cover slip. Make sure the block is as small as possible without exposing your sample (otherwise it may be lost later).                                                                                                                                     |                                                                  | ![[20220617_153405 1.jpg]]                                       |

## Substitution and resin embedding
*This step skips using propylene oxide in favor for ethanol.*

1. Make a 1:1 solution of ethanol:resin and use it to infiltrate your samples **overnight** with motion.
	1. *Orion’s advice*: Make the solution more ethanol than resin (Ex. 60:40, 65:35)
2. First thing in the morning, take out the ethanol:resin solution and replace with 100% resin for 2-8 hours with motion.
3. Remove old resin and replace with 100% fresh resin for 1-4 hours with motion.
4. Place the sample in molds with resin and polymerize at 60C for 1-2 days (2 preferred).
