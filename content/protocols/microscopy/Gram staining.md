# Gram staining

[[gram-stain-protocol-2886.pdf]]

## Protocol
1. Flood air-dried, heat-fixed smear of cells for 1 minute with crystal violet staining reagent. 
	1. Please note that the quality of the smear (too heavy or too light cell concentration) will affect the Gram Stain results. 
2. Wash slide in a gentle and indirect stream of tap water for 2 seconds. 
3. Flood slide with the mordant: Gram's iodine. Wait 1 minute. 
4. Wash slide in a gentle and indirect stream of tap water for 2 seconds. 
5. Flood slide with decolorizing agent. Wait 15 seconds or add drop by drop to slide until decolorizing agent running from the slide runs clear (see Comments and Tips section). 
6. Flood slide with counterstain, safranin. Wait 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
7. Wash slide in a gentile and indirect stream of tap water until no color appears in the effluent and then blot dry with absorbent paper. 
8. Observe the results of the staining procedure under oil immersion using a Brightfield microscope. At the completion of the Gram Stain, gram-negative bacteria will stain pink/red and gram-positive bacteria will stain blue/purple.
