# Melted agar slides
>[!gear]
> - Ethanol lamp
> - Glass slide and coverslip (cleaned) 
> - Metal spade for cutting agar
> - wmy agar plate (no-nutrient agar)
> - Inverted (reverse) forceps
1. Ignite the ethanol lamp and flame-sterilize the metal spade.
2. Cut a small chunk of agar (<1cm<sup>2</sup>) with the spade and place it on a cleaned slide.

3. Gently above the flame, move the bottom of the slide with the agar chunk on it in and out of the flame right before the agar boils.
	1. **Note: This step is difficult; move in and out of the flame to control the agar consistency. The agar will start boiling very quickly.**

4. (**Alternatively instead of 1-3, you can melt the agar in a dish in the microwave and drop onto slide with a pipet.**)
5. Place a clean glass coverslip on the heated agar to spread an even surface of agar on the slide.-
6. Wait for it to cool and harden.
7. Gently slide the coverslip off of the agar by lightly pressing the pad of your finger on the coverslip and providing horizontal force.
	1. **This is a delicate step. You can ruin the agar here.**
8. Put the organism of interest on the agar slide, and you may keep it there longer without drying out by putting the slide in a humidity chamber.
