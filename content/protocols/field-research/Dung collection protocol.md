# Cow poop collection protocol
by Tristan Henderson

>The poop must be as fresh as possible.

1. Gain access to the pastures.
2. Wait for cows to poop.
3. Collect fresh poop using a small plastic sandwich bag.

**Goal:** 3-5 small bags of fresh cow poop.

Collections vary from once every 1-2 weeks to every other month depending on the progress of the study.
