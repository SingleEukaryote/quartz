# High Sensitivity Quantification of dsDNA concentration using Qubit
```ad-reagents
- hs dsDNA kit (Biotium) (Bring buffer and DNA standards to RT).
- hs dsDNA fluorescent dye (Biotium AccuGreen 200X)
```
>[!gear]
> - Qubit tubes for each sample and 2 standards (Label caps not sides)
> - Light blocking tube rack

>Work with Qubit tubes in the light-blocking tube rack. Keep light exposure to the green dye minimal.

1. Prepare stock buffer and fluorescent dye for # of samples + 2 standards + 1 Error margin.
	1. In 1.5mL tube or 15mL tube depending on the number of samples.
	2. 199uL of buffer + 1uL of 200x AccuGreen dye \* (**#** of cDNA samples + 3)
	3. Example for 4 DNA samples: 7x200uL = 1400uL total volume - 7uL dye = 1393uL buffer.
2. *Prepare DNA standard dilutions* in Qubit tubes for standards 1 and 2
	1. 190uL stock buffer + dye solution
	2. 10uL DNA standards 1 and 2 into separate tubes
	3. Total volume is 200uL for each diluted standard
3. *Prepare cDNA dilutions* (1 Qubit tube per DNA sample)
	1. 198uL stock buffer + dye solution
	2. 2uL DNA
	3. Total volume per Qubit tube: 200uL
4. Bring light-blocking tube rack to the Qubit 4 Fluorometer.
5. Incubate at RT: wait 3 minutes before reading.
6. Choose dsDNA>dsDNA High Sensitivity
7. Select read standards, then read the standards.
8. Read the samples and record them in the results section.
9. You may not want to throw away your Qubit samples if you are using them for a PCR template.
	1. Such as [[GoTaq ISPCR for SmartSeq-2]]
