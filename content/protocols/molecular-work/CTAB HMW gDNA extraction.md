## Harvest cells
To remove bacteria from the amoeba cells, use a gravity filtration system with 3.0 or 5 Âµm filter. Rinse the filter with fresh growth medium then add culture. Rinse membrane 2-3x with fresh growth medium. Remove filter from filtration unit, transfer it carefully to 50 mL tube with the bottom side directly against the side, and scrap the cells directly in the tube toward the bottom. Add several time a couple of fresh media to rinse the cells until the filter is clean. (Alternatively, add filter to a petri dish first and scrap the cells there before transferring into 15 ml falcon tube or Eppendorf tube). Pellet amoebae via centrifugation: 10000xg, 4-8*C, 10 minutes and remove media. Flash freeze in liquid Nitrogen 5x and store at -80*C long-term or process with extraction protocol.

Optionally:
For adherent cells in liquid flasks. Make a 1:1 solution of media to Trypsin (0.25 in EDTA). Remove supernatant from each flask. Add enough trypsin/media to cover the flask and watch under dissection scope, when cells release from the flask collect them into a tube. Spin between 500-4000xG to collect cells in pellet. Flash freeze in liquid Nitrogen and store at -80*C long-term or process with extraction protocol.
