# PCR DNA Purification using MagBind beads

![[Pasted image 20220321135036.png]]
>Use a 1:1 ratio (volume of PCR product → uL of beads to add)
*Chosen to select against 100bp sized primer dimers*

[[Evaluation of Omega MagBind TotalPure NGS Beads.pdf]]

```ad-reagents
- MagBind Beads, NGS Omega. Vortex well. Bring to RT. 
- Fresh 80% Molecular Grade EtOH (aliquot by pouring not pipetting) in a 15mL tube.
- EB (Elution Buffer) - Stored at RT already.
```
>[!gear]
> - Well labeled autoclaved 1.5mL tubes for each purified product.
> - Micropipets
> - Magnetic tube rack

1. Take PCR products out of thermocycler or freezer onto a rack.
2. Add equal amounts of MagBind beads to as much sample you have for a 1:1 ratio.
	1. Ex. 22uL MagBind beads to 22uL of sample to a total of 44uL.
	2. A 1:1 ratio will select for DNA that is >150bp. Long fragments are selected for. (See figure above.) Use the ratio you need to remove fragments you don’t want (like primer dimers).
3. Mix well by pipetting up and down.
4. Incubate at RT for 8 minutes. (Put beads back in fridge during this time.)
>*These steps are on the magnetic tube rack*
1. Place samples on the magnetic rack, wait 5 minutes.
2. After 5 minutes, remove the clear liquid without disturbing the beads.
3. Wash the beads using 200uL 80% EtOH to each sample, letting it stand for 30 seconds.
4. Remove and discard EtOH.
5. Wash the beads again using 200uL 80% EtOH to each sample. Let it stand for 30 seconds.
6. Remove all EtOH from the samples, and let the tubes sit (lids open) to dry for 5 minutes.
	1. Use a 2.5uL pipet to take out small EtOH droplets to speed up this drying process.
	2. This step is **critical**. Do not remove tubes from the magnet or your DNA will fly away.
7. Add 17.5uL EB to each sample, pipetting over the beads, hydrating them.
>*Remove from magnetic rack*
1. Mix EB and beads thoroughly with the pipet.
	1. Get any residual beads off the walls of the tubes and into the liquid.
2. Let it incubate at RT for 2 minutes away from the magnet.
3. Place samples back on the magnetic tube rack (make sure the liquid and beads are next to the magnet)
4. Incubate on the magnet for 2 minutes.
5. Transfer 15uL of the clear supernatant (cDNA elute) to each new labeled 1.5mL tube. Do not touch the beads.
6. Store in -20C or use immediately in -20C or use immediately.
