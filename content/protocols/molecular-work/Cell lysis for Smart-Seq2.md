*Take these out of the freezer and thaw on ice:*
- [[Cell lysis buffer (without H2O)]]
- [[Reverse Transcriptase Master Mix]]
- dNTPs (10mM)
- [[Dilutions of stock reagents|Oligo dTs]] (10uM)
```

>This protocol assumes your cell is in liquid, and you will pipet it in 0.3uL of volume into 2.0uL of cell lysis buffer. If youâ€™re picking your cell from a solid substrate, use 2.3uL lysis buffer.

1. Check starved cells under a stereoscope or light microscope or
2. Pipet 2.0uL of cell lysis buffer (w/o H2O) into each PCR tube for however many cells you want to process.
	1. Keep lysis buffer on ice unless when placing cells in the tube.
3. Set pipet to 0.3uL, and pick single cells using this volume. 
	1. *Trick:* Use a p200 to create current to blow the amoebae off the surfaces so that you can swoop in and get a floating cell. 
	2. Alternatively, you can use a thin glass pipet for more precision.
4. Pipet each cell (0.3uL worth) into individual PCR tubes with lysis buffer in them. PUT BACK ON ICE. 
5. Grab isopropanol, dry ice, and lead block from -80C freezer.
6. In two plastic trays: pour -80C isopropanol into one tray and room temperature water from the tap in the other tray. Set the dry ice in the isopropanol tray.
7. Move tubes to the PCR tube dip rack. 
8. Using the dip rack, do 6 rounds of freeze-thaw cycles by holding the bottoms of the tubes in the isopropanol (or lead block) and moving it to the room temperature water for thawing; then repeat 5 times.
	1. This step is especially important for large amoebae with thick glycocalyces. 
9. Move tubes (on ice) to the molecular bench space.
