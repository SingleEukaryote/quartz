# DNA Purification using Magnetic Beads for Smart-Seq2

```ad-reagents
- MagBind Beads, NGS Omega. Vortex well. Bring to RT. 
- Fresh 80% Molecular Grade EtOH (aliquot by pouring not pipetting) in a 15mL tube.
- EB (Elution Buffer)
```
>[!gear]
> - Well labeled autoclaved 1.5mL tubes for each isolate
> - Micropipets
> - Magnetic tube rack

1. Take PCR products out of thermocycler or freezer onto a rack.
2. Add 25uL MagBind beads to each sample (to a 50uL total volume, 1:1 ratio)
3. Mix well by pipetting up and down.
4. Incubate at RT for 8 minutes.
>*These steps are on the magnetic tube rack*
1. Place samples on the magnetic rack, wait 5 minutes.
2. After 5 minutes, remove the clear liquid without disturbing the beads.
3. Wash the beads using 200uL 80% EtOH to each sample, letting it stand for 30 seconds.
4. Remove and discard EtOH.
5. Wash the beads again using 200uL 80% EtOH to each sample. Let it stand for 30 seconds.
6. Remove all EtOH from the samples, and let the tubes sit (lids open) to dry for 5 minutes.
	1. Use a 2.5uL pipet to take out small EtOH droplets to speed up this drying process.
	2. This step is **critical**. Do not remove tubes from the magnet or your DNA will fly away.
7. Add 17.5uL EB to each sample, pipetting over the beads, hydrating them.
>*Remove from magnetic rack*
1. Mix EB and beads thoroughly with the pipet.
	1. Get any residual beads off the walls of the tubes and into the liquid.
2. Let it incubate at RT for 2 minutes away from the magnet.
3. Place samples back on the magnetic tube rack (make sure the liquid and beads are next to the magnet)
4. Incubate on the magnet for 2 minutes. gh
5. Transfer 15uL of the clear supernatant (cDNA elute) to each new labeled 1.5mL tube. Do not touch the beads.
6. Use 2uL of newly acquired cDNA for Qubit.
7. Put the remaining 13uL into the -20C freezer in the appropriate box. This will be used for library preparation.

â†’ Use Qubit reaction for [[GoTaq ISPCR for SmartSeq-2]]
â†’ Once you have enough cDNA for a sequencing pool, start the [[Nextera XT Library Prep]] process.
