# Extracting DNA from Bacteria Isolates

Modified from [[QuickExtract DNA Extraction Protocol]]

1. Put 30uL of QuickExtract solution into each labeled PCR tube per isolate.
    1. The less QuickExtract you add, the more concentrated the DNA will be.
    2. Keep on ice.
2. Pick a colony using a sterile pipet tip.
3. Put the cells in the QuickExtract solution.
4. Transfer the tube(s) to a thermocycler and incubate at 65°C for 6 minutes.
5. Mix by vortexing for 15 seconds.
6. Transfer the tube to a thermocycler and incubate at 98°C for 2 minutes.
7. Pipet the DNA extract from the PCR tube to a labeled 1.5mL tube with the following information:
	1. Isolate name
	2. Date
9. Store the DNA at –20°C in the bacteria isolates box. Note its position in your journal.
    1. Keep on ice and use immediately.
10. Use the extracted DNA as a template for PCRs.
    1. Ex. Used 1 uL of this as template for 18S PCR.
