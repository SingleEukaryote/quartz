# Results

| Isolate Name | SS or C | Organism | cDNA concentration (ng/uL) |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
|              |         |          |                            |
|              |         |          |                            |

Below 1 ng/uL of cDNA is probably bad if you want to continue to Illumina sequencing.
