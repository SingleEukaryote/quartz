# Smart-Seq2 for a whole liquid monoculture

###### Examples
[[2022-03-19]]

###### Required aliquots
[[Reverse Transcriptase Master Mix]]
dNTPs
[[Dilutions of stock reagents|Oligo dTs]]
[[ISPCR Master Mix]]
GoTaq Master Mix
[[Dilutions of stock reagents|ISPCR Primers]]

>Grow up 5-7 small flasks of the organism. The more cells, the better. Some do 10-50 flasks for high quality transcriptomes.

## Protocol annotation

1. [[Direct-zol RNA Miniprep - RNA Extraction]]
2. [[High Sensitivity Quantification of RNA with Qubit]]
3. [[Poly-A selection of mRNA using NEBNext Magnetic Isolation Module]]
4. [[Reverse Transcription Reaction for Smart-Seq2]]
5. [[ISPCR Reaction for Smart-Seq2]]
6. [[DNA Purification using Magnetic Beads for Smart-Seq2]]
7. [[High Sensitivity Quantification of dsDNA using Qubit]]
8. [[GoTaq ISPCR for SmartSeq-2]]

# Results

| Isolate Name | Organism | SS or C | RNA Extract Conc. (ng/uL) | cDNA Conc. (ng/uL) |
| ------------ | -------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
|              |          |         |                           |                    |

Below 1 ng/uL is probably bad
