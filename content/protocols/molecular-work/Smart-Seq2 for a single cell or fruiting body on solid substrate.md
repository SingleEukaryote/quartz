[[Smart-Seq2 for Protists]]
# Smart-Seq2 for a single cell or fruiting body on solid subsrate
*Getting transcriptomic data from single cells.*

###### Examples
[[2022-03-06]]

###### Required aliquots
[[Cell lysis buffer (with H2O)]]
[[Reverse Transcriptase Master Mix]]
dNTPs
[[Dilutions of stock reagents|Oligo dTs]]
[[ISPCR Master Mix]]
GoTaq Master Mix
[[Dilutions of stock reagents|ISPCR Primers]]

## Protocol annotation

1. [[Picking and lysing cells (or fruiting bodies) with a platinum wire]]
2. [[Reverse Transcription Reaction for Smart-Seq2]]
3. [[ISPCR Reaction for Smart-Seq2]]
4. [[DNA Purification using Magnetic Beads for Smart-Seq2]]
5. [[High Sensitivity Quantification of dsDNA using Qubit]]
6. [[GoTaq ISPCR for SmartSeq-2]]

# Besides the protocol
### Blunders

### Notable Notes

# Results

| Isolate Name | SS or C | Organism | cDNA concentration (ng/uL) |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
|              |         |          |                            |

Below 1 ng/uL is probably bad
