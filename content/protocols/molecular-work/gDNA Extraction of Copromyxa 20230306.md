*Prior, 4 cultures of Coproymyxa protea strains were made using dmg. There were large fruiting bodies of CpSF22 available.*

1. Add 2.5mL of Modified CTAB Buffer into a 15mL tube, add 50uL of Beta-mercapethanol (yeilding a 2% w/v solution). **Pre-warm this to 65C**
2. Pipet 2137uL of SDS-EB into a 5mL tube.
3. Pick Copromyxa fruiting bodies using a flame sterilized needle. Lay the fruiting body into SDS-EB on the surface layer. It should come off easily. Avoid touching the walls of the tube.
	1. I picked about 100 fruiting bodies across 4 plates. I actively avoided the dung. Needle(s) sterilized between transfer to  SDS-EB.
4. Homogenize the fruiting bodies in SDS-EB by gently flicking the tube.
5. Freeze-thaw cells 5 times in liquid nitrogen to 55C water bath
6. Add 2.25mL of prewarmed 65C Modified CTAB buffer by pouring it into the 5mL tube.
7. Add 113uL of Proteinase K (20mg/mL) (final 0.5mg/mL) and invert several times to mix. Incubate at 65C for 90 minutes on an orbital shaker at max speed (total volume: 4.5mL)
8. Add 13.5uL of RNaseA (10mg/mL) (final 0.03mg/mL) and invert several times to mix. incubate at 37C for 60 minutes on an orbital shaker at max speed.
>During this time, you should prepare Phase-Lock gel in 15mL tube: Take a 2.0mL vial of phase-lock light, cut lid off and put into a 15mL tube; Spin at 4000xg for 1 minute and discard Phase-Lock tube. **Do this 2 times.** 
>Also make CI and PCI during this time. 
1. Move cell lysis to first gel lock tube, then add 4.5mL room temperature PCI to the tube and gently invert repeatedly for 5 minutes.
2. Centrifuge at 10C at max speed (13250rcf) in fixed angle for 10 minutes.
3. Carefully collect the top aqueous layer with a wide bore 1000p tip and transfer into the second prepare 15mL tube with Phase-Lock gel.
4. Add 4.5mL CI to the tube and invert gently for 5 minutes.
>[!info] Tip
>Make sure to note how much you are able to collect as it will affect later volumes added. When collecting, keep in mind that it is better to have a little less than to have to re-centrifuge or decrease the purity of your gDNA
13. Spin tube at 14000xg for 10  minutes in fixed angle rotor. (*see notes for step 8*)
14. Collect the top aqueous phase into a fresh 15mL tube using wide bore p1000
15. Add 1/8th volume (0.125x) volume 7.5M NH4OAc (Ammonium Acetate) and mix by gentle inversion
16. Add 1 volume of ice-cold isopropanol and mix by gentle inversion
17. Leave tube at 4C overnight

## Day 2

18. pellet gDNA at 3075xg for 15 minutes at 4C in swing bucket rotor then at 14000xg for 45 minutest at 4C (*We instead pelleted first in the fixed angle rotor for 45 minutes then max speed in the swing bucket rotor for 10 minutes*)
19. Wash the pellet twice with 75% EtOH by adding 1mL cold 75% EtOH to the tube, then spin at 14000xg for 5 minutes at 4C; discarding the supernatant after each wash
20. Remove all remaining EtOH (*you can remove remaining EtOH on sides of tube by pulling them up the side of the tube with finer tips*) and let pellet dry for 5 minutes upside down at RTC
21. Add 66uL of prewarmed 10mM Tris-HCl (pH8). If needed, heat pellet with buffer at 50-60C to help dissolve faster without damaging the DNA
22. store at 4C to avoid freeze/thaw cycles
