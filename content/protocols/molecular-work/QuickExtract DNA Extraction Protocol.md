# QuickExtract DNA Extraction Protocol

## Modified protocol

1. Put 12uL of QuickExtract solution into each labeled PCR tube.
	1. The less QuickExtract you add, the more concentrated the DNA will be.
	2. Keep on ice.
2. Gather as much (monoclonal) cells as possible.
	1. Ex. Pick 12-15 cells (the more cells the better) using minuten needles.
	2. Ex. Concentrate cells by centrifuging.
	3. Ex. Scrap cells from a plate.
3. Put the cells in the QuickExtract solution.
4. Transfer the tube(s) to a thermocycler and incubate at 65Â°C for 6 minutes.
5. Mix by vortexing for 15 seconds.
6. Transfer the tube to a thermocycler and incubate at 98Â°C  for 2 minutes.
7. Store the DNA at â€“20Â°C for up to 1 week, or at â€“70Â°C for longer periods.
	1. Keep on ice and use immediately.
8. Use the extracted DNA as a template for PCRs.
	1. Ex. Used 1 uL of this as template for 18S PCR.
