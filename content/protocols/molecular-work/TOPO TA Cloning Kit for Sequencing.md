# TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing
[[TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing Manual.pdf]]
```ad-kit
- TOPO TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen)
	- All reagents stored on ice when in use, and in the -20C for long term storage.
	- Leave S.O.C. medium on the bench at RT.
```
```ad-reagents
- GoTaq PCR product to clone (ex: 18S gene)
- 50ug/mL Kanamycin LB agar plates pre-warmed at 37C
- 50ug/mL Kamamycin LB liquid media
```
>[!gear]
> - Incubator with a tilting machine in it. (Warmed at 37C)
> - Water bath at 42C
> - Labeled 1.5mL tube

## Cloning reaction

1. In a 1.5mL tube, set up the following cloning reaction for a total volume of 6 uL:
	1. 3 uL of nuclease-free water
	2. 1 uL of PCR product
	3. 1 uL of Salt solution
	4. 1 uL of TOPO vector
2. Mix the reaction gently and incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature (22Â°C to 23Â°C).
	1. This step has a higher incubation time for the >1kb nucleotide length. The incubation time can vary from 30 seconds to 30 minutes.
3. Place the reaction on ice.
4. Add 2 ÂµL of this TOPO Cloning reaction into a vial of One Shot chemically competent *E. coli* and mix gently
	1. (**DO NOT MIX USING A PIPET FOR SOME REASON**).
	2. Mach1-T1R cells.
5. Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
6. Heat-shock the cells for *exactly **30** seconds* at 42Â°C without shaking.
7. Immediately transfer the tubes to ice.
8. Add 250 ÂµL of room temperature S.O.C. medium.
9. Cap the tube tightly and shake the tube horizontally (200 rpm) at 37Â°C for 1 hour.
10. Spread 10â€“50 ÂµL from each transformation on a pre-warmed Kanamycin plate.
	1. To ensure even spreading of small volumes, add 20 ÂµL of S.O.C. medium.
	2. We recommend that you plate two different volumes to ensure that at least one plate will have well-spaced colonies.
11. Incubate plates at 37Â°C overnight.
12. Take 2â€“6 colonies and culture them overnight again in LB + Kanamycin liquid media.
13. Isolate plasmid DNA using a miniprep kit.

## Miniprep isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria

### PCR conformation of gene insertion
4. Analyze the plasmids for inserts by restriction analysis.
