# High Sensitivity RNA Quantification with Qubit
```ad-reagents
- hs RNA kit (Bring buffer and RNA standards to RT).
- RNA fluorescent dye reagent
```
>[!gear]
> - Qubit tubes for each sample and 2 standards (Label caps not sides)
> - Light blocking tube rack

>Work with Qubit tubes in the light-blocking tube rack. Keep light exposure to the dye minimal.

1. Prepare stock buffer and fluorescent dye for # of samples + 2 standards + 1 Error margin.
	1. In 2mL tube or 15mL tube depending on the number of samples.
	2. 199uL of buffer + 1uL of 200x dye reagent \* (**#** of RNA samples + 3)
	3. Example for 4 RNA samples: 7x200uL = 1400uL total volume - 7uL dye = 1393uL buffer.
2. *Prepare RNA standard dilutions* in Qubit tubes for standards 1 and 2
	1. 190uL stock buffer + dye solution
	2. 10uL RNA standards 1 and 2 into separate tubes
	3. Total volume is 200uL for each diluted standard
3. *Prepare RNA dilutions* (1 Qubit tube per RNA sample)
	1. 198uL stock buffer + dye solution
	2. 2uL RNA
	3. Total volume per Qubit tube: 200uL
4. Bring light-blocking tube rack to the Qubit 4 Fluorometer.
5. Incubate at RT: wait 3 minutes before reading.
6. Choose RNA>RNA High Sensitivity
7. Select read standards, then read the standards.
8. Read the samples and record RNA concentration in the results section.
	1. Need 1-5ug of total RNA.
