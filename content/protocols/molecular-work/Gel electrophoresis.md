# Gel electrophoresis

## Making the gel

```ad-reagents
- 1x [[TBE Buffer]] or [[TA Buffer]]
- GelGreen Nucleic Acid Gel Stain ([Biotium](https://biotium.com/product/gelgreen-nucleic-acid-gel-stain/))
- Agarose powder
- [[Brown Lab DNA Ladders|DNA Ladder]]
```
### 1% Agarose gel
*(Convenient for regular PCR products visualization)*

| Mold Size | Wells   | Agarose (g) | TA/TBE (mL) | GelGreen (uL) |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Small     | 6/10/12 | 0.3         | 30          | 3             |
| Medium    | 10/14   | 0.6         | 60          | 6             |
| Large     | 12/20   | 0.9         | 90          | 9              |

### 1.8% Agarose gel
*(Convenient for RNA or cDNA visualization)*

| Mold Size | Wells   | Agarose (g) | TA/TBE (mL) | GelGreen (uL) |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Small     | 6/10/12 | 0.54        | 30          | 3             |
| Medium    | 10/14   | 1.08        | 60          | 6             |
| Large     | 12/20   | 1.62        | 90          | 9             |

### Protocol
1) Weight the desired agarose amount on the scales (do not have to be super precise) and pour it on a glass jar.
2) Select the required TBE or TA volume on a cylinder (add a small extra to compensate evaporation) and pour it on the previous glass jar.
3) Boil the mixture in the microwave and remove it with heat gloves (1:15 min should be enough for a small gel).
> Leave the mixture cool until ~ **55Â°C** (i.e. temperature allowing to hold the bottle without burning sensation). If you are hurried or have large volume, you may use a cold-water bath to speed the process.

> **_Note_**_: If you waited too long the agarose will solidify in the jar, in this case you have to repeat step 3._

4) Once the mixture is cold enough add the GelGreen Nucleic Acid gel Stain and mix the solution.
5) Place the mold perpendicularly into the electrophoresis tank and add the comb.
6) Pour the mixture.
7) Wait a minimum of **15 minutes** that the gel solidifies.
>_Note: if the gel is prepared in advance, cover it with grey paper to **protect it from light**._

>_For more than 8 hours of delay, place the gel in the refrigerator in a plastic bag with a wet grey paper on top._

## Electrophoresis protocol

1. Carefully remove the comb and place the mold parallelly into the electrophoresis tank.
2. Pour TBE 1x until the gel is fully covered.
>**_Note_**_: If you rather use a TA gel, then pour TA instead of TBE._
1. Cut a band of Parafilm and place a drop (i.e. ~1 Âµl) of **Gel loading Dye purple 6x Biolabs New England** per sample on it (it is stocked in the Fridge on the top orange rack).
2. Add to this drop between **1Î¼l** (cloning) and **3Î¼l** (usual PCR) of PCR product and mix.
>**_Note_**_: If you want to control RNA quality: 1) prepare a 1.8% agarose gel, 2) mix 5_ Âµl of RNA with 5 Âµl of Formamide in PCR tube, 3) heat at 65Â°C for 5 min and 4) put on ice.

1. Transfer carefully all the mixture to an empty well of the gel but not the first and the last.
2. Add **2 Î¼l** of Quick-Load purple 1kb Plus DNA Ladder (or 100bp) in the first and last well (it is stocked in the Fridge with the dye).
3. Connect the electrophoresis tank to the power supply. As the DNA and RNA are negatively charged they will run toward the positive, so use the black cable from the â€œ-â€œ to the wells-side of the gel and the red cable from the â€œ+â€œ to the bottom-side.
4. Switch on the instrument and select 100 volt for 30-45 minutes for a 1% gel or 80 volt for 60-90 minutes for a 1.8%.
>**_Note_**_: You can always follow the migration front if you added the reaction buffer. If you use a lower voltage and higher duration the gel quality should be better than the opposite._

1. After the electrophoresis, remove the gel and clean the support and comb with water before rinsing with deionized water.
2. If you do not plan to perform another electrophoresis soon, pour all the TBE from the tank to the recycling TBE jar in order to save it (you can use it at least 10 times before renew it!). Once it is too dirty, then pour it on the sink (do we have more ecological alternative???--> I found that this product is harmful for aquatic lifestyle but at the same time that it is not problematic in this concentrationâ€¦).

## Transilluminator (UV Block)

1. Place the gel without the mold in the center of the transilluminator.
2. Close the door and turn on the UV.
3. Open the software ImageJ
4. Click on the logo camera
5. Select the gel limit with ctrl-shift-x
6. Invert the color with ctrl-shift-i
7. Open the contrast panel with ctrl-shift-c and search the best parameters.
8. Save the picture in the right folder and rename it appropriately.
9. Print the gel on the connected little printer machine on the right.
10. **Turn off the UV light**, take out the gel and threw it away it in the common trash bin.
11. Clean inside of the transilluminator with DI water or ethanol.
