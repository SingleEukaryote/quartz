# Picking and lysing cells (or fruiting bodies) with a platinum wire
*Used for fruiting bodies, single spore picks, or standing cells (like Sappinia pedata).*

## Picking cells and lysing them
>[!gear]
> - Ice bucket with ice
> - Two plastic trays for freezing step
> - PCR tube dip rack
> - 2.5uL pipet and tips
> - PCR tubes, labeled
> - Platinum wire
> - Ethanol lamp
> - Reverse forceps```

*Take these out of the freezer and thaw on ice:*
- [[Cell lysis buffer (with H2O)]]
- [[Reverse Transcriptase Master Mix]]
- dNTPs (10mM)
- [[Dilutions of stock reagents|Oligo dTs]] (10uM)
```
-**Clean the molecular work areas with bleach solution as you are working with RNA**-

1. Check for cells (or spore structure) under light and stereoscope. Record pictures and/or video of the cell you intend to pick under light microscope. Move to stereoscope.
2. Pipet 2.3uL of cell lysis buffer (w/ H2O) into each PCR tube for however many cells you want to process.
	1. Keep lysis buffer on ice unless when placing cells in the tube.
3. Light ethanol lamp next to stereoscope.
4. Pick up a small piece of platinum wire with reverse forceps and flame sterilize it.
	1. Wait for it to cool down.
5. Pick cell with the end of the platinum wire. (You only need to touch the cell briefly. It should stick to the wire immediately.)
6. Place the wire down onto the tube side with the cell-end facing the lysis buffer.
7. Spin the tube in the microfuge so that the end with the cell is immersed in lysis buffer.
8. Grab isopropanol, dry ice, and lead block from -80C freezer.
9. In two plastic trays: pour -80C isopropanol into one tray and room temperature water from the tap in the other tray. Set the dry ice in the isopropanol tray.
	1. Alternatively, use the lead block to freeze the tubes instead of dipping.
10. Move tubes to the PCR tube dip rack or manually hold the tube bottoms in the liquids.
11. Using the dip rack, do 6 rounds of freeze-thaw cycles by holding the bottoms of the tubes in the isopropanol (or lead block) and moving it to the room temperature water for thawing; then repeat 5 times.
	1. This step is especially important for large amoebae with thick glycocalyces.
12. Move tubes (on ice) to the molecular bench space.
