# Establishing non-fruiting *Copromyxa protea* strains

- Try 1:
	- After 4-5 passages to [[wMY]] agar with mg only, and to one wmy + ampicillin plate with amp resistant E. coli as food, a passage back to [[DMG]] yields no signs of fruiting behavior. Passage to [[Dung Powder Agar (DPA)]] with mg also yields no categories of aggregative spots.
