> The goal here is to convert pixels in an image to micrometers. For this, we need a microscopic ruler (AKA a stage micrometer).

(to write up)
**Frugal**: use a coin (American penny)
**Precise**: Use a calibrated precise stage micrometer


1. Take pictures of ruler (2mm) at all magnifications
2. Note everything about the set up
	1. Camera
	2. Sensor
	3. Image size (L, 6000x4000x pixels for example)
	4. Objective
	5. Phototube mag
3. Open images in ImageJ
4. Draw a line across multiple 0.1mm markings, through each 50um marking as well as straight as possible.
	1. It helps to draw it close to the 10um markings without touching them to use as a guide for straightness
5. Go to the menu and click Analyse>Plot Profile (command+K usually)
6. Use this plot to gain an average measurement for pixels per 50um.
	1. Draw a line between peaks and click measure (command+M)
	2. Do 5-6 and take the mean by right clicking the results window and clicking summarize
	3. Round mean to the nearest pixel, and use this for your 50um measurement
7.
