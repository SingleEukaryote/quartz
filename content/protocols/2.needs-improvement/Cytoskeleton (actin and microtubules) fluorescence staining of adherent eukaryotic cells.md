## Prepping the cells (The night before staining)
 >Concentrate cells from a culture using one of these methods:

>[!gear]
> - Cell culture chamber slide (NEST, LAB-TEK)
> - p1000 pipet


*For liquid cultures*
1. Concentrate cells with a filter.
	1. Choose a mesh size smaller than your cells.
	2. Suspend cells in liquid, push carefully onto the filter.
	3. On the filter membrane (the side with the cells), pipet 1000µLfresh media onto the membrane and pipet up and down slowly to suspend cells off the filter.
	4. Pipet the 1000µL of cells into a chamber slide.
2. Pour off method
	1. Pour off excess liquid from the culture, leaving ~2mL of media left with adherent cells on the bottom.
	2. Use a cell scrapper to suspend the cells in the media.
	3. Use a p1000 set at 1000µL and use the old media to wash the bottom of the culture flask.
	4. Pipet 1000µL of the cell suspension into a chamber on the chamber slide.

*For agar cultures*
1. Cut a block where there is dense area of cells
2. Place upside down on chamber culture slide.
3. Add 1000µl of liquid media (same media as the agar) and allow to sit for overnight for cell attachment to the slide.

**Always check cells under the inverted scope (phase contrast preferred) before staining.** Make sure they are adhered.

## Staining protocol (~3.2 hours)
>[!reagents]
> - [[8% Paraformaldehyde (PFA)]]
> - 1X [[Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)]]
> - 1X [[Serum Blocking Buffer]] (Goat preferred or Bovine)
> - [[Primary Alpha-Tubulin Antibody Dilution]] (1:500) 
> - [[Secondary Antibody Dilution (Alexa Fluor 594)]] (1:1000) Goat x Mouse
> - ActinGreen 488 ReadyProbes ([Thermo Fisher](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R37110?SID=srch-srp-R37110)) R37110
> - NucBlue Live ReadyProbes ([Thermo Fisher](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/R37605?SID=srch-srp-R37605)) R37605
> - Fluoromount-G (Thermo Fisher)

>[!gear]
> - p1000
> - Fume hood
> - 1.5H cover slip (22x22mm)
> - Transparent nail lacquer/polish

>Prepare enough reagent working solutions as listed for each sample. Prepare FRESH primary and secondary antibody dilutions before you proceed. The blocking buffer may be made in bulk beforehand.

>If cells were grown on agar, remove agar block gently. Be sure to remove all agar chunks.

1. Fix cells under fume hood by adding 1000µL of 8% PFA to each chamber (dilutes to 4% PFA).
2. Incubate at room temperature for ==*20 minutes*==.
3. Discard liquid into a designated PFA waste container.
4. Rinse gently for ==*5 minutes*== by adding 500 µL PBS to chamber's side and allowing the liquid to gently flow down onto glass surface.
	1. Wash a total of **three** times.
	2. Aspirate liquid completely after final wash.
5. Add 500 µL of Serum Blocking Buffer per chamber (this is the blocking agent).
	1. Incubate for ==*10 minutes*== at Room temperature .
6. Add 500 µL of diluted primary antibody to the chamber slide.
	1. Incubate for ==*30 minutes*== at Room temperature .
	2. This will bring your entire volume up to 1000µL..
	3. For a negative control, add 500 µL of PBS.
7. Add 2 drops of ActinGreen 488nm ReadyProbes to each chamber slide.
	1. Incubate for ==*30 minutes*== at Room temperature .
8. Gently remove liquid with a p1000 and discard.
9. Rinse gently for ==*5 minutes*== by adding 500 µL PBS to chamber's side and allowing the liquid to gently flow down onto glass surface.
	1. Wash a total of **four** times.
	2. Aspirate liquid completely after final wash.
10. Add 500 µL of 1:1000 secondary antibody to each chamber and incubate for ==*15 minutes*== at Room temperature .
	1. Keep dark by covering with a box.
	2. Proceed without removing secondary antibody.
11. Add 2 drops of ActinGreen 488nm ReadyProbes to each chamber slide and incubate for ==*10 minutes*== at Room temperature .
	1. Keep dark by covering with a box.
	2. Proceed without removing.
12. Add 2 drops of NucBlue ReadyProbes to each chamber. Continue to incubate at Room temperature for ==*10 minutes*==.
13. Discard liquid gently using p1000.
14. Rinse gently for ==*5 minutes*== by adding 500 µL PBS to chamber's side and allowing the liquid to gently flow down onto glass surface.
	1. Wash a total of **three** times.
	2. Aspirate liquid completely after final wash.
15. Remove culture slide chamber sides from their casing.
	1. Follow manufacturer instructions.
	2. May require a removal tool depending on the brand.
16. Mount your sample using a drop of Fluoromount-G.
	1. Use a bulb pipet.
17. Place a clean 1.5H cover slip (22x22mm) on one side of the chamber area.
	1. Allow the coverslip to gently set down to avoid air bubbles.
	2. Incubate at Room temperature for ==*15 minutes*== .
	3. Keep dark by covering with a box.
18. Seal the edges of the cover slip with transparent nail lacquer.
	1. Let the nail lacquer dry for ==*15 minutes*== at Room temperature . Keep dark by covering with a box.
19. Store slides in a slide holder in the fridge.
	1. For long-term storage, store in a slide box in the -80C.
	2. Keep in the dark until use.
20. Visualize slide on a fluorescence microscope with DAPI, GFP, and TexasRed cubes or on a confocal microscope with 405, 488, 532/561 nm excitation lasers.
