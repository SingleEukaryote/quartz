Use a microwave-save container (I use a 250 mL flask).

1. “Sterilize” the container by filling with tap water and microwaving for 5 minutes.
2. Pour out the tap water, fill with of bottled spring water using [[Sterile technique]] to the desired volume of media needed. (20mL per plate typically)
3. Add your agar powder to the flask.
	1. For 1.5% agar plates (the standard), times the volume in mL by 0.015 to get the grams of agar powder to add
4. Place flask in microwave and run for 2 minutes while monitoring the boiling of the mixture. Stop the microwave as soon as you see the mixture boil. Spin the flask around by hand to encourage the agar to dissolve and microwave until boiling again. Repeat this process twice until a clear liquid is acheived.
5. Prepare empty sterile plates and pour the molten agar into them as soon as you open the microwave.
