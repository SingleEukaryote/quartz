# Centrifugation of different cell sizes
Cryptodifflugia: 500rcf
Smaller cells: 2000rcf (at most)

700 for vanella?
500-1500rcf depending on cell size

- **Bacteria (e.g., E. coli)**: Often require centrifugation at around 6,000 to 10,000 g.
- **Yeast cells**: Typically require centrifugation at around 3,000 to 6,000 g.
- **Mammalian cells**: Usually require centrifugation at around 500 to 2,000 g.
