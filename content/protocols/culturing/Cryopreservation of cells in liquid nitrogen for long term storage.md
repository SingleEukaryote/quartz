## Preparation

- Prepare sub-cultures and wait until dense with cells before freezing.
	- It is best if there are cysts.
- Make sure Mr. Frosty container has fresh isopropanol and is refrigerated overnight.
- Prepare 5 cryotubes (per culture), and label them with the following:
	- Culture name (Epithet) and Closest taxon name
	- Date
	- Medium
		- Liquid or solid
	- Food (if applicable)
- Make [[14% DMSO]] diluted in the media used for the culture.

## Freezing a culture on solid media



## Freezing a culture in liquid media

1. Make sure cells are adhered to the flask bottom.
2. Pour off all the media from the flask slowly into a liquid waste container.
3. Add **2.5mL** of fresh media to the emptied flask with cells.
4. Suspend the cells within the media using a cell scrapper or another preferred method.
5. (optional) Use a bulb pipet to break up clusters of cells if needed.
6. Transfer the flask to ice and allow to cool for 1-2 minutes.
7. Add dropwise to the flask, **2.5mL** of [[14% DMSO]] solution diluted in the media of the organism.
	1. **Keep on ice!**
8. Use a p1000 to distribute 1mL of cells per cryotube.
9. Take Mr. Frosty out of the refrigerator and move the cryotubes into the Mr. Frosty. Place Mr. Frosty with cryotubes into the -80 C Freezer overnight.

## Transferring frozen cells to the dewer

- Review the dewar inventory to find available space for new cultures.
- Fill out all information and mark the rack, box, and spots you will put the cultures into.

**It is crucial you read through these steps prior and work as quickly as possible in transferring cultures from the -80 C**.
*Working with another person helps speed up the process.*

1. Grab safety gear: gloves, goggle, apron (if you feel you need it.)
2. Review the rack and box you will need to find in the dewer.
3. Take frozen cultures from the -80 C freezer and move quickly to the dewer. RUN!!!!!
4. Open the dewer, and remove the appropriate rack slowly.
	1. Make sure all the liquid nitrogen drains from the rack back into the dewer.
5. After setting the rack onto the ground, remove the holding rod carefully.
6. Take out the appropriate box.
7. Open the container with your cultures and transfer *four* them into the proper locations within the box.
	1. Leave one culture behind for the revival step.
8. Quickly close the box, put it back into the rack, and

<font size=5 color=red><b>PLACE THE <i>HOLDING ROD</i> BACK INTO THE RACK OR THE BOXES WILL FALL INTO THE DEWER.</b></font>

1. Submerge the rack back into the liquid nitrogen of the dewer slowly.
2. Navigate the rack back into its locked holding position so that the handle falls flush with the groove.
3. Before closing the dewer, make sure the N<sub>2</sub> levels are good and **NOTHING** is loose.
4. Put the lid back on the dewer and close it up.
5. Transfer the remaining culture tubes to fresh media for revival. Monitor these revival cultures and mark if it is successful on the dewer spreadsheet.
	1. Prep and label flasks or plates.
	2. Wait for the cultures to thaw.
	3. Add the whole 1 mL to the fresh media and wait until cells appear.

## Removal of cells from the dewer
- Find organism on the dewer spreadsheet.
- Write down its location.

## Checking the N2 level
- Use ruler
- 7 inches is bad
- Fill with liquid nitrogen to the top.
