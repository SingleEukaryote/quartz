### With an insect needle
1. Get inverted tweezers and stainless steel insect pins which have a blunt end and a pointy end.
2. Flame the tweezer end using ethanol burner.
3. Pickup insect pin with the tweezers at the blunt end. Flame it to sterilize the pin.
	1. A platinum wire is used in SS2 because there are magnets used. Here it is fine to use stainless steel for QuickExtract.
4. Pick 12-15 cells (the more the better) with the pointy end of the insect pin.
	1. Try not to touch the substrate the cells are standing on. Only touch the target cells.
	2. You can use multiple pins to get as many cells as you want.
5. Place the pin end with cells on it into the QuickExtract solution.
	1. Centrifuge tube to push the pin into solution more.

#### Special technique
1. Hold the plate in pinching form with thumb and middle finger.
2. Rest the pin in place.
3. Navigate the cell towards the pin by moving the plate. I
	1. Apparently it allows for more steady control.
