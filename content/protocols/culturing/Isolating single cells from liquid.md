# Isolating single cells from liquid
*(For molecular work, perform in the afternoon)*
1. Get a sterile petri dish and put 5 drops of the original sterile media onto it using a sterile plastic bulb pipet.
2. Catch ~5 cells using a [[9. To write/9. To write/Creation of a glass pipet|glass pipet]] under low magnification and put them into one of the drops of the clean media on the petri dish. 
>The following steps are to separate the amoebae from other protists.
4. Moved to the dissection scope to get a bigger field of view of the cleaning process. Look for the amoebae in the drop you put them in.
5. Using a 10uL pipet set at 5uL, catch each amoeba cell (avoid catching a contaminate), then transfer each one into a new sterile drop. 
6. Repeated step 5 a few times by successively moving the cells to new drops until there were no eukaryotic contaminates and only the cells of interest.
7. Suspend the clean cells in the drop, then transfer them to a small plastic eye-shaped dish with fresh sterile media.
8. Starve them overnight or a couple hours.
