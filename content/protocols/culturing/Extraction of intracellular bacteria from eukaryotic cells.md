>- 5 mL [[Kanamycin solution with added salt]] (40µg/mL)

1. Wash adhered culture of cells in 5mL of fresh liquid non-nutrient media.
2. Pour off most of the media in the culture flask.
3. Incubate the sample **overnight** in 40 µg/mL kanamycin.
	1. Does not penetrate the cell membrane of eukaryotic organisms. It should kill environmental bacteria. **The eukaryotic cells will eventually die from kanamycin.**
4. Suspend the cells in the morning by using a cell scrapper.
	1. Most of the cells in the kanamycin flask should be floating already.
5. Pour into 15 mL tubes and centrifuge for 5 minutes at 1000 g.
6. The suspension was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500 g and the pellet resuspended in 5 mL PBS with 0.5% SDS to lyse non-mycobacterial microorganisms. 
7. Decontamination by the oxalic acid method was performed as previously described on both sample parts. After decontamination, the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL PBS of which 0.1 mL were inoculated on LJ medium. 
8. The inoculated media were incubated at 30uC for a maximum of twelve months and were read weekly. Smears of bacterial cultures were stained with the ZN method for the detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The decontamination process was repeated when the culture consisted of a mixture of mycobacteria and other organisms. When the smear was composed of more than 80% mycobacteria, a loopful of the culture was suspended in 400 mL 16 TE buffer and heat-inactivated at 100uC for 5 minutes to release bacterial DNA. For the identification of the mycobacteria, these DNA extracts were subjected to a nested PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene common to all mycobacteria. The PCR products were sequenced using the second primer set by the VIB Genetic Service Facility (Antwerp, Belgium) and identified to the species level by performing a blast-search in NCBI GenBank.
